                <p>Last year (2019-2020), during my studies, we had to build a complete web-app from scratch and as a
                    group we decided to implement our front-end using the React framework. Even though I liked it a lot,
                    this year I decided not to deepen my knowledge in React and instead learn a new front-end framework
                    : Angular.</p>
                <p>I started an online course on <a href="https://openclassrooms.com" target="_blank">OpenClassRooms</a>
                    and finished it
                    in no more than a few days. I really enjoyed it and I have to say that I actually prefer Angular
                    over React!</p>
                <p>This course was not only very interesting, but very usefully since it's a required knowledge for
                    my upcoming internship </p>
                <p>As a side note, this website was made with Angular!</p>

                <p>Similarly as what I said in the Angular information, during last year's project, we used Django as a
                    back-end framework. And yet again, instead of deepening my knowledge in Django, I decided to learn
                    one of the most used back-end "frameworks" : NodeJs and Express.</p>
                <p>I started an online course on <a href="https://openclassrooms.com" target="_blank">OpenClassRooms</a>
                    and finished the
                    basics in a few days.
                    The rest of the course took me more time to complete since it was a more "hands-on" part and I
                    didn"t have a lot of time.</p>
                <p>Django and NodeJs are really different and I enjoy each of them with a slight preference for NodeJs
                    mainly because of it's ease of use.</p>

                        Scouts</a> since I was 5 years old and never skipped a year since then! I went from the "wolf

                    Even though I don't lead the scouts anymore, as a "Unit-Chief" I help the Head-Chiefs from all over

                    days on site to solve these bugs.

                <p>During the first few months of this year, a friend of mine asked me to debug a game he made a few
                    years ago.
                    I quickly realized that his code was very badly organized and that understanding his code and
                    refactoring it
                    would take me way too much time. Therefore, I decided to "quickly" implement a simple game using a
                    MVC-architecture
                    in order to explain to him how things go together and how he should be refactoring his game.
                </p>
                <p>After a bit of thinkering, I decided to implement the famous <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)" target="_blank">Rush Hour</a>
                    game in Python. It wasn't without a challenge but I ended up implementing a solid, functional
                    base-game.
                    Anyone can very easelly add more levels and submit me a pull-request on GitHub!</p>
